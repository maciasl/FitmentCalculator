<code>concept.md</code>

## Description/Motivation

For my project I was thinking of creating a phone application that will allow people to use their cellphone to quickly calculate waht size rims and specifications they need for their cars. I'd like to give different style options too inorder to satisfy the needs of different car enthusiasts.'

## Scope

For this project I plan on having a working wheel offset calculator and a working new tire size calculator. Any other feature like camber adjustment will be considered out of scope and will not be a priority of this project.

## Vision

MY vision for this Fitment Calculator is a user friendly application that will be used by car enthusiast everyday around the world that want to find the perfect wheel offset for their desired fitment style. My vision is for there to be no more fighting over gatekeeping wheel size specifications.
